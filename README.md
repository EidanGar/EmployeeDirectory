# Employee Directory
This web application allows companies to manage their employee information in a centralized and organized manner. With a clean and intuitive user interface, employees can easily add, edit, and delete records for each employee, including information such as name, job title, contact information, and more. The application also includes a directory page where all employees are listed and can be searched and filtered by various criteria.

Users can view detailed employee profiles, which include all employee information in one place, along with the option to upload a profile picture. The dashboard gives a quick overview of the current employee count and provides insights into the distribution of employees based on their job titles, department, or other relevant information.
